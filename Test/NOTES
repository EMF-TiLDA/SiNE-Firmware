## Infrared Protocol ##

All communications are based on a 13-bit RC-5 protocol.

There are 20 beacons, so we need a 5-bit code for those.
Beacons then can be 000, [inverted beacon code] [ beacon code] and only light up if the beacon codes agree.

Tracking codes are 9-bit.
So, [01] [Optional checksum] [9 bit tracking code]

Nodte: At the moment the checksum is just the lowest 2 bits of the tracking code.


EEPROM Data:


Bytes:
Bytes 0-3 are persistent beacon data, a record of which beacons this badge has seen.
00 Beacons 0-9
01
02 Beacons 10-19
03

Bytes 4-5 are the ID of this badge.
Byte 4 is the low order 8 bits of the badge ID.
The lowest bit of byte 5 is bit 9 of the badge ID.
